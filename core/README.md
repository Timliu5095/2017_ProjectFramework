# Core development

- To access the data from database,
    1. A Python 3 distribution needs to be installed, i.e. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/downloads)
    2. Several packages must be installed, if you are using **Anaconda**, run
        """bash
        conda install --yes --file requirements.txt
        """

        or if you are using **pip**, run
        """bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        """

    3. Users may need to fill in the constant variables in `demo.py`
    4. Execute the script by `python3 demo.py`
